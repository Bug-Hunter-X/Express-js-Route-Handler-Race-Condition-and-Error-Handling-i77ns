# Express.js Route Handler Race Condition and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js route handlers: race conditions and inadequate error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a more robust solution.

## Problem

The original code suffers from two main issues:

1. **Race Condition:** Concurrent requests for the same user ID may lead to inconsistent data or double fetching if database operations are not atomic.
2. **Error Handling:**  The code lacks proper error handling for database operations, potentially causing application crashes.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.js` addresses these issues by:

1. Using transactions or appropriate locking mechanisms in the database to prevent race conditions.
2. Implementing robust error handling to catch and handle database exceptions gracefully.
3. Using async/await for better readability and error handling.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the application: `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the solution)

This example highlights the importance of careful error handling and concurrency management when building robust Express.js applications.
