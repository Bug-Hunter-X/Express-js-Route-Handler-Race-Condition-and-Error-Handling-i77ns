const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // ... some database operation to fetch user details using userId ...
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  }
  res.send(user);
});

//Problem: The above code has a potential for a race condition if multiple requests for the same user ID arrive concurrently and the database operation is not atomic. If two requests arrive simultaneously and both check for the existence of the user before fetching the data, both might find the user to exist, leading to double fetching, or inconsistent data being returned if the data is modified between the existence check and the data fetch.

//Another problem: it does not handle exceptions during the database operation properly.  If an error occurs during fetching, the application crashes.  It also does not scale well for larger numbers of concurrent requests.
